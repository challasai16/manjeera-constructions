              am told attitude out of the window. The commitment of the employee
              to deliver the value expected by the employer with no surprises is
              what makes him a true Manjeerite. A Manjeerite achieves better
              accountability by making the effort to understand thoroughly, the
              clear strategic direction of the management, the goals, measures,
              and targets communicated, and the policies, procedures, and
              processes in place.
