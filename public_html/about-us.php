                <h3>ATTACHING IMPORTANCE TO HEALTH</h3>
                <p>
                  Manjeera is dedicated to attaining sustainable health among
                  its employees. The health viewpoint is continuing and
                  sustainable health is measured by more than sickness leaves.
                  Sustainable health at Manjeera is about a continuing awareness
                  of well-being that leads to the satisfaction of employees. The
                  management truly endeavors to understand the employees and
                  their situation. Working with Quality Management is a way to
                  attain sustainable good health among employees, apart from
                  being fair, and keeping promises.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Striving to achieve “Zero Injury” </strong>
                  <br />Safety for its workforce is Manjeera’s top priority. The
                  “Zero Injury” philosophy was adopted long ago. The work
                  culture at Manjeera necessitates all employees, at all levels,
                  to accept ownership of the safety performance objective of the
                  company. The CEO himself is an active participant and promoter
                  of the concept and sets the expectation that worker injury is
                  intolerable on all fronts. The management ensures that the
                  Health and Safety goal percolates through the organization and that
                  every employee, every team, and every project exemplifies that
                  goal.

                  All Manjeera Constructions meet high environmental standards,
                  minimize environmental impact, and save energy. Manjeera
                  embraced the green philosophy much before its contemporaries
                  did, and uses energy-efficient systems, and non-toxic building
                  materials in all its constructions. It adopts eco-friendly
                  technologies such as rainwater harvesting, water treatment
                  systems, and other measures including avenue plantations, and 
                  landscaped gardens to further enhance the quality of life.
